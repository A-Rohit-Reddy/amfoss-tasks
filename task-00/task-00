I faced so much difficulty in dual booting ubuntu. I couldnt get my ubuntu started. The error I faced was during the installation. I faced problem due to the rst which we need to disable in order to proceed. I tried several times to find a way, googled for suggestions but couldnt find a solution. I finally contacted my mentor who advised me to take help of my friends and despite many of them trying , it was of no use. I had the only option of reinstalling the whole windows in order to dual boot , which I could do quite easily. I only could complete this task on the 24th of august.
