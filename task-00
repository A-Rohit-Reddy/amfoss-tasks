Installed linux after facing much difficulty. I faced RST error which we need to disable in order to dual boot. There was no option where we could disable the rst. I tried so much and after so many tries and consulting my mentor , asked my friends , though it was of no help. I finally had to reinstall the whole windows and was able to dual boot it then without much difficulty.
